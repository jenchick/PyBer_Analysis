# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
PyBer, a ride-sharing service, has requested an analysis of their data to determine if there are disparities in program usage, specifically in underserved neighborhoods. 
Two data files were provided:
- City data: contains city, number of drivers, and type of city (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
- Ride details: contains city, date of ride, cost of fare, and ride identification number

The data files were joined to capture a full picture of the ride share details.  Visualizations, using Matplotlib, were created to provide a graphic depiction of the data.

## Results
